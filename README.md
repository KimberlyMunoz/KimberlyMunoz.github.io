This is my homepage. Right now it's just static HTML and CSS and tells people who I am and how to find me.

## Made With

I compile my [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and minify my JS and CSS with Grunt locally. I'm using Peachananr's [One Page Scroll](https://github.com/peachananr/onepage-scroll) for the scrolling effect. 

After compiling my files, I [git pull](http://chrisjamesbk.tumblr.com/post/29982583819/cloning-a-github-repository-onto-your-webfaction-server) into Webfaction, my webhost of choice.
