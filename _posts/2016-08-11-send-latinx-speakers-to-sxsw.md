It's that time of year to vote on what SXSW panels
are making it to the conference next year.
SXSW attracts tens of thousands of influencers to Austin each year to learn
the latest in trends and technology, so even for those of us who aren't attending,
voting to make sure Latinx in tech are adequately represented helps us all.

Each year, people submit panels to be featured at SXSW and
the public votes on the most relevant panels for that year.
I've gathered some of the most interesting panels featuring Latinx in tech,
but there's plenty more.

If you see another panel worth including here, email me at

## The myth-busters and diversity all-stars

Several technology companies have blamed their poor diversity numbers
on a lack of available candidates and "pipeline problems".
CODE2040 is teaming with Pandora, Management of Leadership for Tomorrow, and
technology journalist, Salvador Rodriguez, to bust that myth wide open.

CODE2040 isn't stopping at the pipeline myth. Karla Monterroso and 
Github's Danilo Campos will be talking about how the technical interview
can introduce bias that excludes groups from tech.

Once employers have rejected the pipeline myth and want more feedback on improving their technical interviews, 
Udacity's Ana Diaz-Hernandez is ready with a presentation
on hiring technical staff with techniques that work and won't negatively impact a company's diversity.

Another related panel, Dev Bootcamp is part of a panel with other training camps and technology companies
on non-traditional paths into the technology industry and how coding boot camps can diversify tech.

## Latinx entrepreneurs

The Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative is hosting a panel on
how they're helping Latino business owners scale.
Although Latino-owned businesses grow at a faster pace than non-Latino owned ones,
they lack access to the same venture capital available to other businesses.
SLEI is partnering with other entrepreneurs to discuss programs to help them succeed.

## Education panels

SXSW also has a separate conference SXSWedu focused on education issues.
There's a few panels on promoting role models for Latinas in tech and encouraging
more women of color to pursue STEM fields that look interesting.

## Awesome Latinas in Tech

There's also a few panels with notable Latinas speakers.
The women who organize the [Latinas y Brasileiras in Tech group](http://www.latinasintech.org) are
leading a panel on being Latinas in Tech.

Sara Inés Calderón is also doing a panel on accessibility and inclusion.
She's a Latina web developer, writer and editor of Más Wired.

Zhalisa Clarke at Udacity is doing a panel on how companies and people can start investing in skills 
in new emerging fields like the Internet of Things, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality.

## Bonus panel: Latinas in zines

This one isn't really about tech, but looks amazing anyway.
St. Sucia is a San Antonio-based Latina print zine making space of Latina writers.
Their panel is all about how zines claim space for marginalized stories that need to be told.
